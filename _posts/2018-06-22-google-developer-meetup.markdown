Last night I attended the [Google Developer Group Reading & Thames Valley](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Reading-Thames-Valley/) meetup. I don't attend as often as I'd like, but this is a really nice meetup that often has interesting technical presentations.


Last night's session was "[TensorFlow with Laurence Moroney](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Reading-Thames-Valley/events/251227517/)", where [Laurence Moroney](http://www.laurencemoroney.com/) (a Developer Advocate from Google) gave us an introduction to AI, Machine Learning, and some specifics around [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/).

I really enjoyed the presentation. The content didn't go massively deep on AI or Machine Learning, but it was a good introduction to the topic with some nice demos/examples that helped frame things.

I particularly liked Laurence's closing comments. He made the point that as many parts of the tech industry turn to AI/ML, there are great opportunities for people to skill-up and to get a head-start. Doing so could also be a way for groups who are currently under-represented within the industry to break through "glass ceilings".

Thanks to [@GDRReading](https://twitter.com/gdgreading) for organising a fun evening, and to [@lmoroney](https://twitter.com/lmoroney) for the presentation...and the round of beers at the pub after!
