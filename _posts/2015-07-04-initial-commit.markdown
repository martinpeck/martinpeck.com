Finally, after a very long time, I've got off my backside and thrown togther the most basic blog possible. I used to have a blog hosted on MSDN from my Microsoft days. That's been untouched for some time now, but it still has one or two almost-interesting things on it (to me, at least). It's here if you want to see it: [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mpeck/](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mpeck/)

I've picked [Jekyll][jekyll] to build my blog partly because I'm using it in my day job, but mostly because I love the way it works. Working in markdown, and building a static site from that content, makes a lot of sense to me. I'd much rather edit my posts in Sublime Text, and use git to publish them, than deal with a CMS. [Jekyll][jekyll] also appears to be the tool of choice for a number of major blogs too, including [the StackOverflow blog which has just moved acrosss from Wordpress](https://blog.stackexchange.com/2015/07/how-we-built-our-blog/), so I'm in good company.

Anyway, I'll try and update this site with something new once a week. I can't always promise it'll be useful or interesting.

There's plently for me to do here. I need to apply some styles, get some analytics hooked up, and make this place feel more like home...

... I'l let you know how that goes.
