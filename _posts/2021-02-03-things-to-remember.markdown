excerpt: A work-in-progress list of things that you should remember when writing code (especially in teams of developers)
---

This is a work-in-progress list of things to remember when writing code. 

Some of them are especially useful if you're writing code in a team of developers.

Keeping this list in mind will, I believe, make you a better software engineer. 

They're in no particular order.


## It's Not Your Code
 
- You don't own the code you write. Don't get attached. 
- If someone comes along and improves it, that's fine. 
- If someone comes along and *deletes it* that's even better!

## Own Problems

- Own the problems you find in code. 
- Own bugs. It doesn't matter who originally wrote the code.
- Problems and Bugs are opportunities to lean, and to better understand the system. Embrace them.

## Get On and Write Some Code

- Don't let perfection be the enemy of good.
- Code doesn't have to be prefect first time round. Or second. 
- Make you code better over time, until it's good enough. No more.
- code > documentation > talking

## The Only Thing Better than Writing Code is NOT Writing Code

- Look for ways to *not* write code
- Look for ways to delete code 

## You're Bad at Writing Code

- You're bad at writing code. 
- You don't understand what the code does. 
- Your code will fail. 
- Write your code, and tests, with this in mind

## You're Even Worse at Remembering Stuff

- script and automate the boring, repetative stuff
- for any codebase that is useful, make setup/run/debug as simple as possible
- think about the next developer who will look at your code, and how they will get up to speed
- the next developer to look at your code may well be future-you

## Ask for Help

- Ask people for help. Help others when they come asking.
- Be humble

## Be Methodical

- Change one thing at a time.
- Come up with a hypothesis, make a change, see if it holds true.
