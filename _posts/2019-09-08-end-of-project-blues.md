excerpt: After working hard on a project, or after hitting a significant milestone, I often feel "down" or "low" as the pressure comes off.

---

Over the last few months me and my team have been working *really* hard on particular project. In fact, over the past couple of weeks we've had to put in a lot of effort (and hours) to hit an important milestone.

Working long hours, and pushing yourself, is not sustainable long term. I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I, or my team, were consistently having to push ourselves that hard. However, when I'm part of a team that's working together, getting things done, and focused on acheiving something, I find it really enjoyable. It's exciting.

And then sometimes you hit a milestone, or deliver the product, and there's a period of time when the pressure comes off, and you're not having to push as hard...

... and, right now, I'm in that situation and I'm missing the buzz I was getting from the project. In fact, I'm feeling pretty low.

I know it won't last; I'll feel better in a few days. Also, the lull has allowed me to catch up on some admin, reading, and blogging! But right now, I'm sort of missing it.
