excerpt: I've uninstalled the Facebook app from my mobile devices. Here's why.
---

I've decided to uninstall the Facebook iOS apps from my iPhone and iPad. I'm not going full-on #deletefacebook. I've just decided that I won't have them on my devices. I'll still visit the Facebook.com website, and I still use Messenger (though, not as much as I used to), but I've decided to...

- delete the iOS apps
- remove any use of Facebook as a login mechanism for sites or other apps
- delete/remove all of authorised apps from Facebook
- lock down many of the privacy settings on my account

There are a number of reasons for this:

## 1. The apps have become buggy

I've had trouble with the apps recently. They fail to load content, or content disappears really quicky (I see it once, then it's gone). I've logged feedback/bug reports on this issue 3 times over the last 6 months, but they all get closed with "thanks for the feedback", and the issue remains.

## 2. The recent press around Facebook

I've been a defender of Facebook for some time. I've always figured that if I'm stupid enough to share my personal life with others, on their platform, then I'm inevitibly going to see targetted adverts. However, there have been a string of pretty bad news reports regarding Facebook recently that have made me less likely to defend them. I'm not deleting the apps because of these news reports, but the #deletefacebook movement has certainly been in my thoughts.

## 3. I don't post content that often

Other than holiday photos, I've not posted much to Facebook recently. I think this is because my kids are a older now, and the number of times I'm sharing "family photos" has dropped.

## 4. My Friends don't post that often

I'm not sure if this is related to the "apps being buggy" thing, but I don't see that much content being posted by my friends. When they're working, I'll often open the apps and see 1 or 2 new posts per day, and then a bunch of stuff I've already seen.

Overall, I'm sort of bored of Facebook. And, having spent 2 weeks without the apps on my phone, I've not missed them at all. Perhaps I'll find myself being dragged back into FB at some point, but for now I'm taking a break.
