Hi. I'm Martin Peck. I've spent the last 20+ years getting paid for writing software and leading teams of software developers. When I'm not doing that I'm generally doing whatever my family tell me to do.

## Microsoft (again)

I'm currently a Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, within the Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team. I manage a small team of Software Engineers, and focus on "compute" things, such as serverless, containers, and Kubenetes. I get to contribute to OSS software, and I don't have a Windows machine. I <3 the new Microsoft!

## Code Club
I was previously the Director of Engineering for a fantastic not-for-profit called [Code Club][codeclub] . Code Club's mission is to help kids learn about writing code and to get them excited about technology in general. Volunteers help run after school clubs across the UK. I happen to be one of those volunteers, running a club in a local school.

[**Get involved!**][codeclub] It's easy, fun and incredibly rewarding. I run my own Code Club at a local school and it's one of the highlights of my week.

## blinkbox Movies and blinkbox Books
I have worked for blinkbox (previously part of Tescos) within the blinkbox Movies team and blinkbox Books team.

Within [blinkbox Movies][blinkbox] I was the Head of Client Device Development. In this role I was responsible for the development of the client apps that blinkbox owned (website, mobile apps, games console and set-top boxes).

In the blinkbox Books team I was Director of Engineering, and helped build an engineering team and launch a brand new eBook service.

Sadly, Tesco sold blinkbox at the start of 2015. blinkbox was full of excellent people, and I loved working there.

## Microsoft
I worked for Microsoft, in the UK, for just over 10 years. During that time I worked on a number of projects, but for the last 5 of those years I worked within Microsoft Mediaroom. I headed up a remote dev team in the UK that was part of the San Francisco based product group.

We shipped an IPTV platform that's used around the world by many Telecoms companies.
