title: About Me
---

Hi. I'm Martin Peck. I've spent the last 20+ years getting paid for writing software, helping other people write software, or preventing people from writing the wrong software. When I'm not doing that I'm generally doing whatever my family tell me to do.

## Code Club

[codeclub.org.uk][codeclub]

I'm currently the Director of Engineering for a fantastic not-for-profit called [Code Club][codeclub] . Code Club's mission is to get kids enthusiastic about programming and technology in general by setting up and supporting a network of after school clubs. It's aimed at 9 to 11 year olds and it's a fantstic cause.

**Get involved!** It's easy, fun and incredibly rewarding. I run my own Code Club at a local school and it's one of the highlights of my week.

## blinkbox Movies and blinkbox Books

[blinkbox.com][blinkbox]

I used to work for blinkbox (previously owned by Tesco, before they decided to sell it off) where I was the Head of Client Device Development for the Movies team (basically, responsible for the development of all the UIs that blinkbox shipped, across all devices) and then went on to be Director of Engineering for blinkbox Books.

Sadly, the books team was disbanded when Tesco decided to sell off the blinkbox companies. The Movies team lives on and is now part of TalkTalk.

blinkbox was full of excellent people, and I loved working there.

## Microsoft

I worked for Microsoft, in the UK, for just over 10 years. During that time I worked on a number of projects, but for the last 5 of those years I worked within Microsoft TV. I headed up a remote dev team in the UK th was part of a Mountain View based product group. The product that we shipped was an IPTV platform which is currently used around the world by many Telecoms companies. Microsoft TV is now called Mediaroom, and is part of Ericcson.
